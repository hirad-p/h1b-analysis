# H-1b Analysis
This repo contains our efforts to conduct analysis on a dataset containing information on H-1B Visa applications. 

## Dataset
To keep consistent, all datasets should go in the `./data` directory of repo. In addition, if you feel inclined to include additional data, please add a link to it below:

  * [H-1B Visa Petitions 2011-2016](https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa/data)
  * [United States Geocodes](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ansi_statetables.html)
  
Also, if you are reading a dataset using an API or some other means, feel free to write the data to file in the same directory so that we don't have to keep calling the API. 

## Requirements

    In your terminal window type the following: `$ pip install numpy`.
